1.Distribution is infinite-dimension. See from Glivenkoâ€“Cantelli theorem. Take Normal distribution as an example. We may think it only has two parameters--mean and variance in its probability distribution function. But it takes the normal distribution as a beginning assumption. And this assumption stands for the rest infinite dimension, that is if we take no assumption on the distribution type in advanced, we need infinite data to get its probability distribution. And use the emperical distribution function to calculation with formula.(MCMC, EM and something else).
